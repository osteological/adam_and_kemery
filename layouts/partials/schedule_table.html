            If you choose to stay for the after-party, you’ll need to coordinate a ride back to your vehicle or home.
            We recommend <strong>Brunswick Taxi (207-729-3688)</strong>, which runs late. Uber may be available if drivers are nearby.
            <br><br>
            Don’t want to drive at all? The <strong>Metro Breez</strong> bus runs between Portland and Downtown Freeport.
